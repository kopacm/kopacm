## 🚀 Featured Projects

I recently completed an end-to-end data initiative, demonstrating the full lifecycle of data—from engineering the infrastructure to delivering executive-level strategy.

### **Phase 1: The Build (Data Engineering)**
**🏗️ [End-to-End Data Warehouse Construction](https://github.com/kopacm/sql-data-warehouse-portfolio-project/blob/main/README.md)**
* **The Challenge:** Sales data was fragmented and unoptimized for reporting.
* **The Solution:** Designed and built a modern Data Warehouse (Bronze/Silver/Gold architecture) to serve as a single source of truth.
* **Tech Stack:** `SQL Server` `Data Modeling` `Medallion Architecture`  `ETL Pipelines` `Star Schema Design`.

### **Phase 2: The Insight (Data Analytics)**
*Leveraging the warehouse above, I performed a deep-dive customer retention analysis.*

**🚴 [SQL Data Analysis: Churn Analysis](https://github.com/kopacm/SQL-Data-Analysis-Project/blob/main/README.md)**
* **The Diagnosis:** Identified a **$907k revenue leak** driven specifically by "One-and-Done" buyers in the US market.
* **The Pivot:** Disproved a popular acquisition hypothesis ("The On-Ramp"), showing it had a **0% conversion rate**, saving wasted ad spend.
* **The Solution:** Developed **"The Bridge Strategy"**—using SQL cohort analysis to prove that cross-selling accessories increases customer retention by **1.57x**.
* **Tech Stack:** `SQL (Window Functions, CTEs)`, `Cohort Analysis`, `Customer Segmentation`, `Hypothesis Testing`.


### 3. 📊 [Tableau Sales & Customer Dashboards](https://github.com/kopacm/Tableau-Sales-Project/blob/main/README.md)

**Focus:** _Data Visualization & UI Design_

- **Objective:** Enable stakeholders to track YoY performance and customer segments.
    
- **Solution:** Built dynamic dashboards with parameter-based year selection, dual-axis charts, and custom calculated fields (`WINDOW_AVG`, `FIXED`).
    
- **Tech:** `Tableau` `Calculated Fields` `Dashboard Design`
